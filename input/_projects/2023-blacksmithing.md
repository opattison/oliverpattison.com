  [David Bradley](https://www.farmersforge.org) is an artist and blacksmith who makes heirloom ironwork at the [Manitou Art Center](https://www.manitouartcenter.org). He primarily crafts functional cookware. The metal is crafted with care and precision under many iterations into the flame and out again, rapidly heated and cooled, shaped like a living material.

This project is a proof-of-concept for the kind of mode and style I want to work in – immediate and intimate, with a dense and high-contrast look. I hope to document many artists within the Colorado Springs arts communities in this manner.
