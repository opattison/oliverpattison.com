  '
  As a part of my [Art Emerging](/2023-art/) project, these are scenes of people in Colorado Springs at gatherings, performance spaces, and arts venues building community together.
  
  
  Relationships between people are essential to building a richer and more successful arts community. We need people showing up, supporting artists directly, being generous with their time and resources, sharing their creativity, and being inclusive of new perspectives.
