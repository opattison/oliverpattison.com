## Redcloud and Sunshine

These two peaks in Hinsdale County, Colorado are best hiked in one day, at the same time. They are fairly accessible as fourteeners go, but are still strenuous hikes mostly above tree line. The views from the top are some of the most exceptional in the state, surrounded by a wild landscape with almost no human development visible in all directions. Being at the top of these mountains is one of the most remote and alien experiences I have had while hiking.
