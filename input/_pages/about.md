introduction: 
  'I take pictures in a humanistic style for individuals, families, and businesses who want a realistic document of their life or work.
  
  
  I shoot in a quick and candid style, with subjects in their natural environments. I tend to take mostly unposed pictures, but I can also collaborate with you to create a scene or story. I am a careful editor who can help shape a narrative for you and deliver consistent results in a distinctive style. I want to help you create honest and emotional photography, whether through a portrait or framing a small moment in your life.'

## More About Me

I live in Colorado Springs with my partner Jean and our dog Sapphie. Living here balances my love for living near the mountains with access to a city that has so many opportunities to connect with other people, go hiking and running, volunteer, and build community.

## My Process

I care about what photographs are eventually used for and that informs the approach I take. Some people need photographs for a straightforward business need, but there is still a big difference between pictures that tell a cohesive story, or connect emotionally with an audience, and pictures that do not. Other people need a portrait, but there is a big difference between a portrait that is a flattering picture of a person’s face, and a portrait that shows what a person is really like in their living environment. Knowing what a photo is for is essential to getting that balance right. I am particularly interested in how the human experience can be preserved through still photography, especially when complemented by evocative storytelling with writing, audio, or video.

You’ll want to hire me because:

- I’m friendly and easy to work with.
- I know my photography gear and related technical skills, but I won’t bore you with it.
- I am willing to spend a long time with a subject or scene to get results, but I don’t waste time when actually taking pictures.
- You want something authentic and unposed that is not a mere snapshot.
