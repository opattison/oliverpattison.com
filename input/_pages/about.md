My name is Oliver and I am a photographer in Colorado Springs. I take pictures in a humanistic style for clients who want a realistic document of their life or work.

I shoot in a quick and candid style, with subjects in their natural environments. I tend to take mostly unposed pictures but I can also work within a story you would like to tell. If you work with me, I am generous with my time and attention. I am a careful editor who can help shape a story for you and deliver consistent results in a distinctive style. I want to help you record something honest and emotional, whether through a portrait or framing a small moment in your life.
