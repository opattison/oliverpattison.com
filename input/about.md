## My Approach

I shoot with a quick and candid approach, with subjects in their familiar environments. I tend to take mostly unposed pictures, but I can also collaborate with you to create a scene or story. I am a careful editor who will shape a narrative for you and deliver consistent results.

## More About Me

I live in Colorado Springs with my partner Jean and our dog Sapphie. Living here balances my love for being near the mountains alongside access to a city that has so many opportunities to connect with other people, go hiking and running, volunteer, and build community.
